"""Representative-set reader over the real-team library (data/teams/<season>_<format>.jsonl).

Real teams are REAL JOINT objects: each member's ability/item/nature/moves co-occur, which the meta
usage panels (independent marginals) cannot give — so this is the higher-accuracy source for those
fields and the cure for the marginal-stitch problem. When a format partition has no usable rows, every
function returns None/[] and the resolver falls back to meta: the system stays stable with no real data.

Boundaries:
- FACTS ONLY. `count`/`sample`/`share` and the performance tags (placing/record/rating) are
  provenance, never a synthetic strength score.
- NEVER merged across single/double (different metagames) — keyed by format, loaded per format.
- The SP/spread dimension is carried only when the raw row exposes a real Champions SP spread, so
  `sps` is the modal LEGAL spread AMONG the teams running the modal set (it co-occurs — not a
  marginal stitch). Rows without a spread yield `sps: None` and the resolver falls back to the meta
  spread. Never invent a spread.
- The spread has its OWN sample (`spread_count`/`spread_sample`/`spread_confidence`): only some of the
  modal-set teams carry a spread, so the spread's confidence is folded from THAT thinner sample — it
  never inherits the set's. All present, legal spreads are treated uniformly regardless of source;
  illegal lines (per-stat/total cap violations — e.g. an EV-format paste) are never counted.
- Spread aggregation is per investment SHAPE, not per exact line: exact SP lines fragment naturally
  (players fine-tune ±few points; defensive lines are per-calc bespoke while offensive lines
  standardize, so an exact-modal pick is also systematically biased toward offense). The dominant
  shape cluster carries the confidence share axis; the emitted `sps` is the modal EXACT line WITHIN
  that cluster — always a real observed line, NEVER a per-stat average/synthesis (that would be a
  fabricated spread nobody runs, poisoned by bimodality). A second shape big enough to matter is
  disclosed (`spread_shape_runner_up`), mirroring how (item, ability) clustering guards bimodality.

This module holds NO battle data — only the reader/aggregator over the dev-built library.

    one global modal would hide that bimodality. Each archetype = the modal joint set WITHIN its
    (item, ability) cluster, ranked by cluster size; only clusters with >= `min_sample` teams qualify.

    `item` (optional) restricts to members holding that item before clustering — used to resolve a Mega

    Per-set fields beyond the global-modal shape: `cluster` ({item,ability}); `coverage` (the cluster's
    share of the QUERIED pool); `species_sample` (that pool's size); `species_sample_total` (the

    species — so consumers must read coverage against `pool_label`/`item_filter`, never as base-species
    coverage (audit 2026-06-26). `share`/`confidence` are denominated WITHIN the cluster. Returns [] when
