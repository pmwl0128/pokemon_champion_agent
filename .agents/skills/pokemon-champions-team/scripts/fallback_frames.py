"""Fallback frame table — where a frame comes from for an anchor that NO current-rule real team
carries (design §19.10, the fallback ladder).

The table is built once per data refresh (`dev/update/team/fallback.py`) and read by `frame`. It
stores a RECIPE per anchor, not a skeleton: which evidence pool the frame is computed over. `frame`
then materializes the skeletons with its ordinary machinery, so the table can never drift from the
current skeleton shape and every set it hands over is still grounded the ordinary way.

Three sources, tried in this order at build time:
  1. history   — older-rule partitions of the same format that DO carry the anchor. Teams built
                 around the anchor itself: the highest-fidelity structure available (rules only
                 ever add species, moves and items, so those teams stay valid as they are).
  2. partners  — the anchor's published usage partners, filtered to the ones that say something
                 about THIS anchor (not partners of everyone, or partners it pulls far above their
                 own usage rank), and only when real current teams carry those partners together.
                 The partner list selects the pool; the pool is real joint teams.
  3. stand_in  — a data-backed species doing the same job (explicit predicate hits: shared types,
                 attacking lean, speed band, field-setting ability, functional moves — counts, never
                 a similarity scalar). Its frames are lent to the anchor.

Boundaries (same as every library operator): no score, no winner; the table picks a POOL, never a
team; nothing here is a stored team handed to anyone.
