"""Environment structural landscape (UEP P4): how REAL successful teams are structurally laid out.

The anti-mediocrity data leg (§A.C ②): instead of guessing "what a team usually looks like" from
training priors, the AI reads the real library's structural DISTRIBUTIONS — speed-control modes,
functional-role norms, observed co-occurring cores — and builds its OWN team against them.

Discipline (plan §P4 + §A.D, pinned by tests):
- COUNTS + sample + share only; never a strength ordering, never a best/recommended anything.
  Field naming guard: observed_* / sample_count / source_kind; best_* / recommended_* / *_score
  are banned (test walks the key tree).
- The library takes part ONLY as aggregation/co-occurrence — no whole team is ever echoed here
  (that is `search`/`show`'s AI-facing lane, with its own disclosure).
- Same yardstick as every other structural consumer: each team is projected through `profile`
  (UEP S), so landscape norms and a candidate's profile are directly comparable.
- Single/double never mixed: the caller loads ONE format's library (repset.load_teams).
- `order` is a VIEW ordering (meta_conformance knob: proven=common-first, off_meta=rare-first over
  the SAME facts) — it reorders, it never scores.

The meta partner_pairs fallback planned for a thin library is NOT wired: both formats currently
exceed the thin bar (勘误①), so it would be dead code — a thin library is flagged `thin: true`
honestly instead (the fallback lands with the singles data track if the need returns).
