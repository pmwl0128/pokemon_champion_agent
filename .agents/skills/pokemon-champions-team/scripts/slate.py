"""slate-evaluate (UEP P5): the candidate fact-matrix gate — 2–5 AI-assembled candidates go through
ONE uniform pressure test, so "compose it, then just write the answer" has no cheap path.

Capability chain (§A.B): the slate must carry the `audit_receipt` of a context-audit run on EXACTLY
this context — the fingerprint is recomputed here and a mismatch refuses (honest boundary: this
proves the audit ran on this context, not that its gaps were acted on). The output carries a
`slate_receipt` the answer-audit (P6) will require in turn.

Funnel (§A.B — cost is a skip incentive): the CHEAP stage runs for every candidate (structure
contract, legality, constraint satisfaction, structural profile, objective gap flags); the
EXPENSIVE battery (matchup vs the meta top-K) runs only for survivors. An eliminated candidate
carries its reasons and never bills the battery.

Output discipline (pinned by tests):
- INPUT ORDER preserved; no aggregate column, no winner, no score — a comparison grid the reader
  may sort by any column.
- flags are OBJECTIVE gaps (an archetype may deliberately accept one), never defects.
- Evidence addressability (勘误④a): every quantitative extreme carries
  `evidence_id = "ncp:{fmt}:{attacker}|{defender}|{move}"` — re-runnable coordinates (one ncp calc
  with the same resolved sets), the hook P6's claim↔recompute check binds to.

    `canon_team_fn` canonicalizes a candidate ONCE — its result feeds species extraction, validate,
    profile AND the battery (one dex round-trip per candidate, and constraint membership compares
    canonical names, symmetric with the team side — self-audit 2026-07-02: three separate re-canons
    plus raw-name set ops falsely eliminated alias-named locks). `constraints_ctx` is the
    CANONICALIZED context view for the membership checks; the RAW slate context stays the receipt's
    binding target (the fingerprint is over the context as written).

    Refusals (`refused` set, CLI exits 2): slate not a dict / no teams; audit_receipt not the full
    receipt object (a bare fingerprint string is the predictable mispass — the context-audit md
    summary shows only the fingerprint; external session 2026-07-07); missing audit_receipt;
