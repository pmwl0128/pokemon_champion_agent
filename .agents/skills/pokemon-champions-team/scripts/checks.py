"""Derived CHECK-GRADE classification over `matchup` cell facts (design §5 L2 派生视图).

FACTS-ONLY. A cell's check is an ORDINAL LABEL + the booleans that produced it + evidence_ids +
disclosed caveats. It is NEVER a scalar score and is NEVER summed across members/opponents into a
team "check score" (design §1/§16 — the no-composite red line). A consumer may count grades as a
distribution, but any cross-team/cross-opponent RANKING is the AI's / front-end's judgment, never a
skill-emitted number.

Model (frozen rubric — the audited turn-budget engagement, not a static threshold):
  * The engagement is a 1v1 with the opponent already on field. We evaluate TWO lines:
      - same_field : both already out.        incoming = kill_hits - (we_act_first ? 1 : 0)
      - switch_in  : we pivot in on its move.  incoming = 1 + kill_hits - (we_act_first ? 1 : 0)
    `incoming` = how many enemy hits we must absorb before our KO lands.
  * grade is the one atomic build-pair axis and is 3-way:
      C2 = switch_in line safe (survive the switch hit + budget) AND we kill  -> "switch-in check"
           (NOT "counter": the engine models no status/recovery/PP/boosts/hazards/multi-turn, so a
           repeatable-wall claim would over-reach).
      C1 = only same_field safe (revenge; cannot pivot in).
      C0 = neither.
    C1 sub-modes (clean_revenge / speed_trade / bulk_revenge / priority_candidate) are UNORDERED
    explanatory descriptors, NOT a strength ladder (they are different failure modes).
  * safe(line) is THREE-VALUED, not a boolean:
      exact_true  : incoming <= 1 — survival rests only on the exact OHKO fact.
      approx_true : incoming >= 2, no survival-worsening ko_caveat — static N-hit approximation.
      uncertain   : incoming >= 2 AND ncp flagged a ko_caveat that could make survival WORSE than the
                    static floor (`understates`/`unclear` direction — Multiscale / Weak Armor / attacker
                    ramp / stat-change ...) — the "repeat hit 1" assumption is unreliable. A caveat that
                    only makes the enemy KO HARDER (`overstates` — Stamina / one-time-survive) does NOT
                    downgrade (we are at-least-as-safe as approx_true).
      false       : the opponent can KO us within the budget (pessimistic: uses ko_possible).
    Hard C2/C1 require safe in {exact_true, approx_true}; `uncertain` never hardens a grade.
    The multi-hit integrity gate REUSES ncp's own ko_caveats detection (design §14 "DETECTED, not
    modelled") rather than a hand-kept unsafe-ability list.
  * Each cell is one named member build × one retained observed opponent build. Its item, ability,
    moves, spread and real speed are evaluated together; uncertainty lives in sibling cells rather
    than a hidden synthetic fast lane. A species roll-up may take an observed floor only after every
    retained build has its own atomic grade and must name the floor's witness build IDs.
  * resolvability — an ORTHOGONAL multi-turn qualifier, NOT part of the ordinal grade. The grade is a
    single-FRAME fact; a positive read (C2 wall / no-KO stalemate / slow grind) silently assumes the
    opponent neither sets up nor heals. When that is DETECTED false the read is `contested`, unless our
    member negates it — Unaware (纯朴) ignores the opponent's stat changes (hard), Haze/Taunt/phaze
    answer at a tempo cost (soft). An applicable accuracy-based OHKO route on either side also marks
    the read `contested` without changing C2/C1/C0. DETECTED not modelled (design §14): no boosted-state
    damage or OHKO probability sequence is run.

Pure functions only: this module consumes already-computed matchup cell facts and calls no
dex/meta/ncp sibling. All damage/speed arithmetic happened upstream in `matchup`.
