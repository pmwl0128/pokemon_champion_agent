"""Selection matrix (M2 core) — OBJECTIVE FACTS ONLY.

Champions is bring-6 / pick-3 (singles) or pick-4 (doubles), and only ONE member may Mega Evolve
per battle. This operator enumerates the legal pick subsets and reports objective facts for each —
who's in it, which member(s) could Mega (and into what), the base-Speed ordering, and the types
present — so the AI can reason about the 6vN choice. It assigns NO strength score and names NO single
best pick; it does not rank combos, only lists them in a stable, neutral order.

Deferred (need design / meta and are marked, not silently skipped): matchup vs a named opponent or
meta top-K, lead/back constraints, doubles partner synergy & speed-control semantics. See `notes`.

External lookups are injected (dex_fn / item_fn) so the logic is unit-testable offline.
