"""Opponent observed-build matchup CACHE (M5 step 2).

A precomputed grid of how retained observed builds of the meta top-K interact — attacker i's hardest
move vs defender j's concrete build, plus their actual speed line, for every ordered pair. It is a
fast REFERENCE, NOT the user's own matchup: a real team is always matched
LIVE via matchup.py against its ACTUAL sets. So the whole cache is stamped `low` confidence
(reason=`vs-observed-build`) — every cell is a retained-build fact, never the user's real board.

This module holds NO battle data. It (a) READS the shipped cache JSON and (b) provides the PURE
`build_matrix` the dev builder (`dev/update/team/cache.py`) calls with injected sibling functions —
the fact-shaping (KO buckets, speed line) lives here so it ships and is unit-tested in the skill,
while the dev side only fetches + writes.

Design discipline (mirrors matchup.py / repset.py):
- FACTS ONLY. No matchup score, no ranking of species, no "best" anything.
- ATTACKER ROWS ONLY FOR REAL-TEAM-BACKED SPECIES: a meta-only species has no
  REAL co-occurring 4-move set (meta gives independent marginals — stitching them is the forbidden
  marginal-stitch trap), so it cannot be an attacker. It CAN be a defender (being hit needs only its bulk:
  ability/item/nature/spread, which the meta modal supplies). This is the literal "build a cell only
  for species clearing MIN_SAMPLE" — the MIN_SAMPLE gate sits in repset and decides who is an attacker.
- Single/double NEVER mixed (one cache file per format, keyed by RULE — the opponent universe is
  the current usage ranking and the sets come from the whole rule pool, so nothing in the content
  is per-season).
- Time-validity follows the environment: source-content fingerprints bind the matrix to its meta and
  same-rule team snapshots. A mismatch fails loudly and requires an offline rebuild.
