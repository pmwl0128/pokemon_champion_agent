"""Deterministic team-level legality validation (M1.2).

Champions rules enforced here (facts pulled from the sibling dex skill):
  - Roster legality : every species must exist in the Champions dex (catches phantom /
                      pre-evolution / removed Pokemon — the dex already is the roster).
  - Move legality   : every move must be in that species' cached learnset.
  - Move count      : at most `moves_per_pokemon` (4) moves per member, and they must be
                      distinct (dex-independent, definitive — like the SP caps).
  - Ability legality: ability must be one the species can have (when dex lists abilities).
  - Mega item match : if a member is given as a Mega FORM, its item must be that form's stone.
  - Species Clause  : each base species at most once.
  - Item Clause     : each held item at most once across the team.
  - SP caps         : each stat <= 32 SP, total <= 66 SP.
  - Team size       : 3..6 members.

NOT a team-registration rule (so NOT enforced here): "one Mega per battle". Champions is
6-bring-3 (singles) / bring-4 (doubles), so carrying several Mega stones in the registered team
is legal and common — only one may Mega Evolve once selected. That belongs to selection analysis
(M2/M3), not legality.

The model decides strength; this module only decides legality and returns concrete
repairs. Unknown facts (e.g. dex unavailable) are reported as warnings, not silent passes.
