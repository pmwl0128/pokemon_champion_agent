"""tune operator: explicit SP benchmark frontiers.

Threat targets come only from `build-context.benchmarks`. Each card preserves the requested
benchmark as its primary objective, reports factual adjacent lanes (probability, allocation,
conditions, nature, or target-set ceiling), and exposes the 66-SP funding trade-off. It never
auto-selects threats, combines unrelated objectives into a score, or emits a single "optimal spread".

All external lookups are injected (damage_fn / move_fn / dex_fn / meta_fn) so the logic is
unit-testable without the sibling skills; defaults wire to ncplink + dexlink + metalink.
