"""Champions registration rule constants, centralized.

These are the registration-period constants the validator (and tune's budget check) enforce.
Centralizing them here — instead of hardcoding in validate_team / tune — keeps those modules in
agreement. Season/source registration also belongs to the updater. Explicit unknown seasons or
rules fail closed: a previous regulation is never evidence that a new one is compatible.

`_RULES` ACCUMULATES; a rollover ADDS the new regulation and never replaces the old one. The
real-team library keeps its rows forever and stays collectible/queryable under their original
regulation (design §10). Explicit additive predecessors are validated against the current rule,
preserving original provenance; lack of other historical authority may still yield unknown. A
regulation whose registration contract was never reviewed (M-A) is deliberately ABSENT rather than
approximated: `is_reviewed` lets callers that only need honest provenance (historical backfill)
degrade to "cannot certify" instead of inventing caps a reviewer never signed off on.

This is a small, stable policy table, not battle data, so holding it here does not violate the
"no duplicate data" rule (same rationale as the type chart living in typechart.py).
