"""context-audit (UEP P2): the front gate — turn "did the AI understand the request?" into
pre-build queryable FACTS.

It audits only the STRUCTURED intent (the build-context the AI translated the conversation into,
plus an optional team-json); it never reads natural language, so a mis-transcription upstream is
out of its reach by design (the answer-audit's disclosure check + the user's reaction cover that).

Output discipline (plan §模糊请求 — surface + verify, never compel):
- facts + THREE-level gap classification only; the audit NEVER decides ask-vs-default for the AI:
    blocking      = no safe default AND a wrong guess wastes the whole build (or erases intent)
    safe_default  = a defensible default exists; applied defaults must be DISCLOSED in the answer.
                    `info_value: high` marks "defaultable, but asking buys a lot" (posture knobs)
    conflict      = the context contradicts itself / the team / the dex (one targeted question)
- `field_status` is THE single source for "which build-context field is mechanically consumed by
  what" (勘误④b): the CLI `schema` NOTE derives from it, and a contract test pins it against
  contracts.CONTEXT_FIELDS so a new field cannot ship unclassified.
- `audit_receipt` starts the capability chain (§A.B): slate-evaluate will require it. Honest
  boundary: a receipt proves this audit RAN on this exact context, not that the AI obeyed it.

Pure/injectable: the dex resolve bridge is passed in, so the classification is unit-testable
offline. No battle data lives here.
