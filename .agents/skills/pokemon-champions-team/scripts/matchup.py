"""Matchup-vs-meta-top-K (M2 L2) — OBJECTIVE FACTS ONLY.

For each of the team's members, report objective matchup facts against the meta's most-used
Pokemon: who outspeeds whom, how the opponent's STAB types hit us (type level), and how hard our
member's own moves hit each retained observed build (damage, via ncp). It assigns NO matchup score,
ranks NO member or opponent, and names NO "best" anything — it lays out facts the AI
reasons over.

Discipline / boundary (mirrors metalink.py):
  - the opponent LIST is the meta USAGE ranking — a published fact ("most-used"), not a synthesized
    threat assessment. It is NOT the marginal-mode threat auto-discovery that this skill
    forbids for tune's SP optimization: here every opponent is named, and we only *report* facts,
    never optimize a spread against them.
  - each ranked species expands into retained observed (item, ability) builds from the rule-scoped
    real-team library. Coverage is sample share, not strength; omitted sample mass stays explicit.
  - our side uses the registered team's ACTUAL set (the moves/nature/SP as brought).

Speed is the integer-exact Champions closed form (cliffs.champ_speed). Type effectiveness is the
built-in chart (typechart). Damage is the sibling ncp calculator, batched in one subprocess
(ncplink.damage_batch) so a members x opponents matrix is a single node call. All external lookups
are injected (dex_fn / set_fn / damage_fn) so the logic is unit-testable offline.
