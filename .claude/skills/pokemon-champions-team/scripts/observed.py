"""observed-team retrieval (UEP P7, route (b)): the AI-FACING evidence source over the real-team
library — teams satisfying / partially satisfying the user's constraints, laid out as FACT rows:
explicit-predicate constraint overlap (hit counts, never a similarity scalar), provenance evidence
tier, recency, raw performance fact tags, and structural signals through the shared profile
vocabulary.

Hard boundary (§A.D, pinned by tests):
- RETRIEVAL, never generation — every row IS a stored team (id-addressable via `show`); nothing is
  synthesized or blended.
- Ordering is ONLY evidence tier / recency / constraint overlap. No strength ranking exists here,
  and none can be assembled from these columns (counts + categories only).
- The output marks `consumer: ai-facing-evidence`: decompose rows into structural facts and
  trade-offs to build YOUR OWN team; never echo a stored team to the user as "the answer"
  (library guardrail — no netdecking).
