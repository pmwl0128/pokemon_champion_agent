"""Provenance-aware opponent-set resolver: real-team JOINT set first, meta marginals as fallback.

The accuracy ranking is: a REAL team's joint {ability,item,nature,moves} beats meta's independent
marginals (no §10 stitch) and can be skill-segmented. Some real-team rows carry NO spread, so for
those the SP/spread still comes from meta; rows that DO expose a spread supply a real co-occurring
spread. So the resolved opponent set is a per-field MERGE:

    ability / item / nature / moves  <- real-team representative set (when sample is sufficient)
    sps (spread)                     <- real-team modal spread when the raw row carries one (co-occurs
                                        with the set, but its
                                        confidence folds the spread's OWN thinner sample); else meta
                                        modal
    fallback (no real-team data)     <- meta modal set as-is (today's behaviour)
    fallback (no meta either)        <- None (caller's synthetic max-offense path handles it)

Every result carries its per-field provenance + confidence; this never emits a strength score, and
single/double are never mixed. Real-team reads are either an exact season partition or a same-rule pool.

Consumers (matchup / tune) inject `resolve_opponent_set` instead of calling metalink directly, so
they upgrade automatically once the real-team library is populated — with an empty library the
result is byte-identical to the meta path, which is exactly how the no-real-data case stays stable.
