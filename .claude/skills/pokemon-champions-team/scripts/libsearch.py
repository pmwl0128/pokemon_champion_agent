"""Real-team sample-library SEARCH — the AI-facing query API over data/teams/<season>_<format>.jsonl.

Answers "does the library contain a team matching these conditions, and what is its exact config?"
without the caller hand-writing a jsonl scan. The query is a list of member SLOTS; each slot is a
conjunction of constraints (species / move(s) / item / ability / nature) and every slot must be
satisfied by a DISTINCT team member. So a query like

    [ {"species": "耿鬼"},
      {"item": "剧毒宝珠", "move": "灭亡之歌"},     # a member holding that item AND knowing that move
      {"ability": "降雨"} ]

means "a team with (some Gengar) AND (a member holding Toxic Orb that knows Perish Song) AND (a member
with Drizzle)", the three matched to three different members.

Facts-only (design §8 / repset boundaries): results are observed configs + counts + a content id. No
synthetic strength score. Condition values are normalized through the dex `resolve` bridge (Mega-compose
+ nicknames + fuzzy), so users type any language / colloquial name; species match is BASE-normalized so
"耿鬼" matches a member stored as either `Gengar` or `Mega Gengar`.
