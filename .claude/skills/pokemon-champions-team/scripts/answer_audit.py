"""answer-audit (UEP P6): the back gate — the receipt chain's LAST link, run on a structured draft
of the answer BEFORE it reaches the user. The audit never reads prose; it reads the draft skeleton
the AI fills (context_summary / recommended+tradeoffs / convergence_rationale / assumptions /
confidence_notes / claims / slate_receipt) plus the ORIGINAL slate input and the SAVED slate output.

Two layers (both here — form first, substance right behind):
- FORM (structural checklist): environment stamped; every recommended candidate re-validates, maps
  by content hash to a slated team and was a battery SURVIVOR; >=1 trade-off each; a single-team
  answer is declared; the convergence scaffold (worst_matchup / accepted_by_constraint /
  opportunity_cost) is filled for EVERY survivor — recommended or passed over; blocking gaps that
  existed at slating are disclosed as assumptions; multi-Mega recommendations and declared
  replacements carry their rationales; low-confidence slate facts are disclosed; no banned
  absolute-strength wording (bounded wordlist — a tripwire, not NLP).
- SUBSTANCE (claim <-> recompute): every quantitative claim carries an evidence_id under the grammar
  OWNED by slate.py (imported — never re-defined here, 勘误④a), and its structured `expect` numbers
  are recomputed through the SAME set construction the battery used (matchup.member_actor/set_actor/
  pair_speed/dmg_fact). A fabricated number is a violation; a sibling outage is a disclosed note
  (honest degrade), never a silent pass of the number.

Receipt chain (refusals, not violations): the draft's slate_receipt must equal the saved output's;
the output must reproduce its own fingerprint from the slate input (edits after the run refuse);
the output's audit fingerprint must match a context-audit recompute of the slate's context.

Honest boundary (pinned by tests + notes): PASS = the form is complete and the quantitative claims
reproduce. It does NOT mean the trade-offs are right — that judgment was never auditable here.
