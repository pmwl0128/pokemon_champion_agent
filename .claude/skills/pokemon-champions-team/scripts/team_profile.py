"""Structural profile (UEP S): ONE archetype-agnostic structural vector for any 1–6 team.

The shared vocabulary for landscape aggregation (P4), slate comparison (P5) and observed-team
overlap (P7): all three must count the SAME structural signals or their numbers can't be compared.

Discipline (plan §S — the banned-vocabulary test pins it):
- FACTS ONLY, all countable/explainable: contributors, counts, bucket distributions.
- NO archetype labels ("balance"/"stall"/"hyper offense" never appear as output values or keys) and
  NO similarity/fit/score scalars. An archetype is something a READER may see when comparing this
  vector against the landscape's real distributions — it is never named here.
- PURE AGGREGATION over the existing detectors (diagnose_defense/offense/speed/roles,
  cliffs.champ_speed, selection's Mega-form resolution). This module invents NO new detection; if a
  signal is missing, add it to the diagnose layer where every consumer gets it.

Injectable (dex_fn/move_fn/item_fn) like the diagnose operators, so it is unit-testable offline.
