"""Anonymous rate limiting + daily model-budget circuit breaker (frontend/design.md §7.4).

Identity is two-keyed and never stores a raw IP: a signed anonymous device cookie AND the
IP hashed under a daily-rotating key (key = H(secret + utc-day), so yesterday's hashes are
unlinkable). A request counts against BOTH ids and is refused when EITHER is over the day
limit — clearing cookies alone does not reset the allowance. Counters live in SQLite so a
process restart does not reset the day; rows expire after three days (§7.4: 24-72h).

Budget: before each LLM task a pessimistic token amount is RESERVED; after it the real
usage is SETTLED. Reservations mean N concurrent requests can never overshoot the daily
budget by racing the counter."""
